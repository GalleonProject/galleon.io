## Philosophy

Public, permissionless blockchains are dependent for their security and reliability on their mechanism design. We believe Cryptoeconomics technology can make the world fair place.

On the Internet, we cannot confirm the reliability of almost all information. We think that there are many areas where needs trusted information on the Internet. The decentralized review process could be one of the ways to assure reliability. People have contributed for free so far on the Internet, but people should be able to receive rewards for intellectual contribution on the future.

We believe a mechanism design approach can achive this as sustainable platform while producing value of trust continuously.


## Innovative points of the Product, Expected results from the Product

Everyone can become a content creator. A content here includes public articles and images on the Internet as well as any transaction records on this real world. On the other hand the CORRECTNESS of those contents is not secured as side effects of such environment of freely creating contents. Galleon can secure the correctness of any kinds of contents by putting review scores based on byzantine fault tolerant review mechanism which is explained in following section, and that is most innovative point of Galleon.

Doing review is becoming a burden to reviewer. Now any contents on the Internet is available without such a burden, so review mechanism does not work unless there are some incentives. Therefore Galleon publish a financially valued token and give that to reviewers as a incentive to do a review. Galleon has a feature of accumulating correctness-secured contents that the Internet does not have, and that correctness is exactly added value. A financial value of Galleon token comes from this added value. 

In addition, Galleon introduces an idea of reputation to each player. Creators who continuously generate correct contents and Reviewers who repeatedly do correct review can get high incentives. The others cannot get such high incentives. By this design will be able to refresh by itself and only correct contents are remained on this platform because only good creators and reviewers will be there. This also means Galleon is sustainable platform.
